Bridge of Spies is yet another fantastic movie from Hanks and Spielberg. I don't think those guys could make a bad movie if they tried.
"""Bridge of Spies"" is yet another spy movie of course...but based on true events...n its perfect."
The same lawyer from Bridge of Spies freed mad prisoners from Cuba. That might've been a more interesting movie than the Cold War joint
