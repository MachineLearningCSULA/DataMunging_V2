Watching the movie Stonewall even though I know it's completely inaccurate
I wish they made another movie about the Stonewall Riots and didn't whitewash history...🙄

Recasting Nancy Reagan &amp; @HillaryClinton as LGBT heroes is like if in the #STONEWALL movie Anita Bryant threw the first brick at the riot.
@_Cambam3 I'm sure people still think that Stonewall was started by white gay men. That movie only came out 1 year ago lol
@_Cambam3 I mean lol.. there is a movie called 'Stonewall' that shows exactly this.

@upperclassgay @Stonewall_Movie depicted so they can gain popularity and profit
@upperclassgay @Stonewall_Movie your're letting your white privilege erase the hardwork of people of color because of what the media has
