Mortdecai
Oh good. They got the guy who wrote Mortdecai to write the new Indiana Joes movie. That sounds just great.
RT @Soooper_Bakar: Movie 24 &amp; 25-Mortdecai with Johnny Depp is awful. Avoid. The Cider House Rules is slow but a good one time watch #100Fi‚Ä¶

Movie time ‚òÖ Mortdecai ‚Äî https://t.co/hSXupcwbnf
"Sad that a Jason Statham movie (Wild Card) kept me awake until the end, but with Johnny Depp (Mortdecai), I checked out in 25 minutes."
MORTDECAI is a movie for 100 year olds
Mortdecai is such a trash movie. But it's trash done so well.
Mortdecai is such a funny movie! I love Johnny Depp and Gwyneth Paltrow.

And then I see Jeff Goldblum is in this movie and now I've died and gone to heaven #Mortdecai
The first ten minutes of Mortdecai were the shittiest ten minutes of a movie I've watched in a looooong time. A v bad Netflix choice

"Last night's movie: ""Mortdecai"" (2015). Bumbling, broke/rich art dealer on the hunt for a stolen painting. Weak, unfunny crime/comedy. 4/10"
