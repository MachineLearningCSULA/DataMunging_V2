Deadpool is a dope ass movie
Deadpool and Spidey &lt;3! They should make a movie detailing their love and heroicness. Lol https://t.co/DSxw0lzIeD
Deadpool is now my fave movie
Deadpool was a legit funny ass movie😂
The first 4 episodes alone of #DaredevilSeason2 are better than the entire Deadpool movie 😈😂😂😂
"""You saw Deadpool? My favorite actor is in that movie.""
""Ryan Reynolds?""
""No... @nottjmiller """
Deadpool Remains The Best Movie So Far

"anytime I go see a movie that isn't Deadpool I'm like, lowkey wishing it were Deadpool"
I loved Deadpool but I just got out of  #Zootopia and I think it has it beat for my movie of the year so far.

"Just got carded at the movies buying tickets for #Deadpool And yes, this is the second movie we're seeing in theatres today #SpringBreak"
Safe to say #Deadpool is hands down the BEST #marvel movie to date.
Deadpool is probably the best movie ever made
Am I being super grumpy or is Deadpool a shit movie?!
My kid's friend's parents let their kid see Deadpool. That's like the most inappropriate superhero movie for kids ever. Besides Flesh Gordon
RT @cbsboston: movie theaters are banning kids from R-rated films https://t.co/NCJNHweL81 2 little ones @ Deadpool unbelievable parenting
Deadpool is probably the best superhero movie to come out in the last 10 years and it shat on everything Marvel has been doing lately lmaoo

I’m sure Batman vs Superman will be highest grossing movie but it took 2 heroes to do what Deadpool did alone so he still wins
