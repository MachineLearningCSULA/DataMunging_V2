"I too saw the movie first, and I prefer the book. Have you read Paper Towns? @ofunne_okocha"
I don't get why Paper Towns was turned into a movie and not Looking for Alaska 😤
I see paper towns a great movie but very sad ending~ John Green doesn't have any book that has a happy ending
"seriously, the only accurate (kind of) book-turned-to-movie was Paper Towns 😡 the rest are   freaking out of range"
