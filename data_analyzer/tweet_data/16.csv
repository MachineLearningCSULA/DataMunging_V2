San Andreas is the stupidest movie ever. Why would you try and save some random bird you just met instead of your brother?
@TravisandAndie @travismcelroy listening to San Andreas BB - bad TV/movie CPR is my pet peeve - so cliche and never done properly!

San Andreas is a cool movie but has dumb stuff in it.
Did San Andreas have a plot? Am I missing something? Why couldn't we just have a buddy movie between Constable Hugh Collins and Roy Harper?
This San Andreas movie making me reconsider this trip to Cali 😓
