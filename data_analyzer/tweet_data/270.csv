Spotlight was a good movie from the first 20 minutes that I saw too.

"Just saw #Spotlight . What an emotional, deep movie. I highly recommend it. @MarkRuffalo 's performance was on point"
"@laurjeff I was being somewhat facetious. SPOTLIGHT is a movie like ""All the President's Men"" &amp; I'd say just as significant."
@GeekFurious I have heard more about SPOTLIGHT for sure. Better movie? Same level of 'good'?
"@laurjeff It came out the same year as that other Massachusetts based gangster movie, SPOTLIGHT. So, it got smothered by its weight."
Really have to recommend the movie spotlight https://t.co/xqXX0M2cAs. Incredibly well done and such a horrifying story really.
Damn spotlight was a dope ass movie. The Catholic Church is so fucked up

Spotlight is a great movie. It shows one of my main reasons as to why I don't fuck with religion anymore. Religion is full of hypocrites.
