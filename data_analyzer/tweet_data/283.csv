Mad Max Fury Road is the only movie so far I have watched without picking up my phone. The rest I tweet during action scenes.

"That is Mad Max Fury Road defined. It was like that part of a movie, just dragged out for 2 hrs with almost no story arc. Flat, dull, boring"
Mad Max Fury Road confirmed most overhyped movie ever. It did nothing to rope me in. Cool visuals but pointless story line. Did not like it.
"@SportsSturm @NotJackKemp @TC1310 Mad Max Fury Road is a great movie! Great action , story and Hardy and Theron are great also!"
