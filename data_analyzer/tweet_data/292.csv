@_iimnmn just watched alice in wonderland. A movie le kids. W still great acting.
still alice is a must watch. it's not a light movie. some people might call it's slow but that way of narration is what makes it so strong
still alice is such a sad movie  :(
Last Tim Burton movie I liked was Sweeney Todd. Still haven't seen his Alice in Wonderland but I will before the sequel this year.

Yo Alice in wonderland was and still is my shit like I will always love that movie (1960's one I mean)
"I didn't intend on staying in my bed and crying tonight, but I watched Still Alice. What a sad, but good movie."
is still alice a good movie???
Still alice was a powerful movie i was sad when it finished and the last scene with Kristen i felt iam about to cry she was fantastic.
Getting the feeling this movie called Still Alice is gonna be a real tear jerker
"Dear females, if you ever need a ""good cry"" and you know that sometimes we just do.... Watch the movie Still Alice! So sad üò≠üò¢ #StillAlice"
I didn't think 'Still Alice' was a very good movie

Was spellbound by 2014 movie 'Still Alice' starring Julianne Moore (@NetflixUK ) The co-directors told the story in such clever visual ways.
