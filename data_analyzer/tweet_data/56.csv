Draft Day
Draft Day is such a good movie
"@MariotaNews @MattLombardo975 sounds like the plot from Draft Day, the movie....  Titan Up!"
this movie comes out the same day as the NFL draft. April is going to be one hell of a month. https://t.co/FJF7UNE8gF
@JimmyReuben Draft Day. Browns movie. Losing. Blind Side lost yesterday. Oher. Former Raven.
@BrownsChalkTalk @JeremyinAkron this reminders me of the draft day movie. Definitely take Jack he will be a Ray Lewis tape player for us.
"@maxthesilent except for draft day, kevin costner is the best sports-movie-specific actor of all time (minimum 3 films)"

@GraphixChic @11michael11 @NickC941 by sports what do u mean. Draft day didn't have anything on field. It was a movie about business.
@mrjmitchell86 @NickC941 Draft Day is a sports movie no question.
@NickC941 is draft day considered a sports movie? #ShowMeTheMoney

Draft Day is such a good movie
Draft Day movie: Three 2nds for the #6 pick in the draft. Cool.
"If the movie Draft Day doesn't make you excited for football season and doesn't give you so much hope for the Browns, you aren't a true fan."
@JayD271 @CLETalkingHeads @Browns lol stop buying jerseys with real names l. you'd be better off buying a jersey from the movie draft day
If only the #browns could have a draft day like the movie draft day......they would probably still find a way to fuck that up #Gongshow
"@scottzolak @Marc_Bertrand Draft Day was a good movie. Great? Hardly, but it was absolutely worth watching @hardy985"
@ZoandBertrand @hardy985 Draft Day is THE WORST sports movie these eyes have ever seen. And I love draft
"@BrownsChalkTalk is it going to be like the movie draft day, we have to make a splash?"
"RT @JayECrawford: The Thing That Came From the Toilet by @JayECrawford #FilmPoops @midnight OK so it's only a draft. 1 day, a B-Movie! http‚Ä¶"

"If #Hollywood can make a #movie about NFL drafting (Draft Day), then they should make one called 'Bracket Day'. #BlockbusterSportsMovieIdea"
Cleveland will always have that awful Draft Day movie. Dream big CLE. Those dreams are ridiculous and full of plot holes. But you can dream.
Mike Francesa is obsessed with the movie Draft Day https://t.co/VAOVLtaOWC via @imgur
"@jonmarks975 @975Mornings Howie Roseman yesterday reminded me of Kevin Costner fleecing the rookie GM from Jax, in the movie Draft Day"
"@BrentASJax Caldwell let too many get away. CB, LB, G.  Acted like rookie GM in Draft Day movie.  Only got 1 Top D player. Aggressive my A$$"
"@ryanohalloran @Rj99326570 Caldwell blew it.  Now I see that the Draft Day movie Jags GM was really based on Caldwell.  Weak, overwhelmed"
I just noticed that superman vs batman movie is released exactly on the day I have to send in a 5k research first draft. Nice
@WUZ1045 Jon Robinson making moves like Kevin Costner from the movie Draft Day #Holysmokes
"Not sure being a NFL GM is much fun this week, I sense a second movie storyline for Costner &amp; draft day err free agent day"
They should make a spin off of the movie draft day called Free Agent day based off the exploits of Howie Rosemen today #EaglesTalk
"@letterboxd is there a way to get rid of a movie on my recent activity? It's bad enough that it's showing Draft Day, but it's there twice."
Browns leading at 66%. But they're in the worst shape every year. Unless you watched the movie Draft day. SB SB SB!! https://t.co/0J9ZkQAFH8
RT @steelersscott: Yes. If I were the Browns I'd be afraid of Ben. And the rest of that offense healthy. Cool movie Draft day u tool. https‚Ä¶

@Browns the movie draft day was not real life. You're not going to pull the biggest surprise and trade ever.
@AMussali me recuerda al GM de los Jaguars en la movie Draft Day...desesperado y sin saber que hacer. Gastar a lo tonto.
"@PewterReport there's s scene in the movie draft day where they mention Adam schefter, feel like that happened with this info"
"@kbigg21 @MattAbbatacola David Putney is the Devon Hester of "" draft day "" entertaining but a horrible movie"
the Broncos are going to need to create a miracle like in the movie Draft Day to save their team this year...
What if Arian Foster signs with the Cleveland Browns making the movie Draft Day come true?üò≥ #justathought #DraftDay #NFLFreeAgency
RT @NFLMemez: His work in the movie Draft Day really paid off https://t.co/kH5AZk6Cbz
I feel like the #Lions needs to watch that Costner Draft Day movie. We're seeing some real interesting moves today https://t.co/2IFn5UakW9
This boutta be some nonsense like the movie draft day
"All these Houston signings got me feeling like the Cleveland Browns at the end of the movie ""Draft Day"""
"@975Middays the movie ""Draft Day"" was actually loosely based on Howie Roseman and the Eagles 2016 offseason/draft"
"@975TheFanatic the movie ""Draft Day"" was actually loosely based on Howie Roseman and the Eagles 2016 offseason/draft"
@CPawlychyn @sebeagles @Jeff_McLane you just move up...doubt you will move down. This ain't Draft Day the movie!
