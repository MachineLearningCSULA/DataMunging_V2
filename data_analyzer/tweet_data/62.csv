"I just watched ""Nightcrawler"", it's the most boring movie ever, such a waste of my time üòí."
So Mystique and Nightcrawler in the same movie? are they gonna acknowledge their relationship? (probably not) #XMenApocalypse

Man the main thing that excites me about the new XMEN movie is nightcrawler is in it!! He's one of my faves!!
"Like Kurt/Nightcrawler is great but the movie versions of him feel so... not right
so yeah mainly jubilee i wanted to see"
movie-verse nightcrawler is half-russian half-american and speaks mostly german
Idea: nightcrawler stand alone movie https://t.co/QrC1LlCrpK
@aidahburne also nightcrawler!!! Take my soul. Give me this movie now and take my soul.
"@Marvel Been thinking about this for the last 7 years and since you took him out of the X-Men movies, you should work on Nightcrawler movie."
"#nowwatching ""Nightcrawler"" - one fucking great movie with an even greater Jake Gyllenhaal!"
Jake Gyllenhall is so creepy in this movie. #Nightcrawler
okay but will the new x-men movie actually acknowledge that mystique is nightcrawler's mother?????
jubilee and nightcrawler are my faves so? ? they better be in the movie more just sayin
@gilchrist_levi yeah. I'm more excited for Nightcrawler than the movie at this point.
I see FOX are holding back the Mystique/Nightcrawler Mother/Son story from the #XMenApocalypse trailer. That must be a twist in the movie.

Watching Nightcrawler with Jake G. He is so damn creepy in this movie. But also a lowlife motherfucker.
