Never judge a book by it's movie -- the two are worlds apart.. The movie will never be able to capture the true magic of a book.
@protoncharging it's supposed to reel the audience and make them want to see the movie. You can certainly judge a film by it's trailer.
"You have the right to kill me, but you do not have the right to judge me. Boom. That's the whole movie. That's life"
Kissing a sleeping woman in an animated Disney movie is romantic but do it on a bus and the judge doesn't agree.
The Judge is Robert Downey Jr's best movie
I'll judge the movie later after finish reading Allegiant
So the movie...is really different from the book. I don't know whether or not to be happy. But I'll wait for part 2 to judge it then.

@ALDUBSONGS Hopefully the writer of MaiChard's movie will be aware of this.It's gonna be a very good material for sure. #ALDENvasionSaYnares
Donald Trump is likely to nominate Judge Judy. At least Obama had the decency to nominate a movie star (Michael Douglas) over a TV star
@MissOMG__ why will anyone judge you..the movie is amazing ..every part of it is beautiful ..be it music or cast üòá
At least the second Asylum movie Judge has been in. His career really went down the crapper after Stargate ended #CinemaZ

"Robert Downey Jr. Does it again. The Judge is a great movie, i enjoy the heart behind it."
"Glad Netflix DVD puts the movie running time on the front of the disc sleeve. That way, I can judge if it is a good value or not."
the goofy movie is the best anime honestly so great makes naruto look like judge judy
"Convinced you can, indeed, judge a person by which movie they think is better than the other: Platoon or Full Metal Jacket. Act accordingly."
If someone doesn't know the movie Jerry Maguire It's going to be so hard for me not to judge. It's a classic
