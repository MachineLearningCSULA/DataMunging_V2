"I love how the Broadway station on Pandora only plays Grease, Wicked and Into the Woods (the movie version). üôÉ"
My sexuality? It Takes Two from Into the Woods movie. That whole scene.
@StacyDacheux That goat and the girl heading into the woods should have been the beginning of the movie.

Wonder if the Into The Woods movie is any good. I'm in the mood for more Sondheim after Sweeney Todd.

Just watched into the woods... was not expecting that ending. Good Movie.
Y'all I'm watching into the woods and I just saw James corden and got so confused but apparently he's in the movie ok
i wish hamilham was a movie. like moulin rouge. or into the woods or something.
Watching Into The Woods in show choir class......AGAIN. Good thing I like the movie.
literally the only moral of the story i got from this movie is don't go into the middle of the woods and fall in love w a robot

Into the woods is such a good movie
"sometimes you gotta just watch into the woods to make the sad go away (the musical, not the movie)"
@mizgillianberry his eyes in the Into the Woods movie slayed me. Whole movie should have just been him walking through a forest (towards me)
into the woods used to be on that list but after seeing 1000000 bad/mediocre productions of it over the past two years + movie i am SO done
"@SOUKOR Hahahaha I think they kinda want this to be a bit of like Lemony Snicket-ish, Harry Potter, Into The Woods kind of movie haha"

The only reason I can watch Into The Woods is because of @AnnaKendrick47 and her perfect performance in every damn movie she is in.
